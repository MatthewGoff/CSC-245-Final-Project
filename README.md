## Dev Notes
- Pycharm will claim that it can't find modules even if it runs. To resolve this
right click on src folder>"Mark Directory As">"Sources Root"

## Todo

### World Editor
- Good enough, no more required
- [ ] Saving/loading during full screen crashes -> Create popup dialog
- [x] Add support for foreground sprites to import/export functions

### Main Game
- [ ] Make a mini-demo with simple walking
- [ ] Write method stubs for each class based on the UML diagram
    - Maybe start on init methods
