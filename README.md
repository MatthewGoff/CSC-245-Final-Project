# CSC-245-Final-Project
Winter 17 class project


## Dev Notes
- Calculating mouse position for click in unnecessary, just collide with tiles
- There should only be one world class

## Todo

### World Editor
- Saving/loading during full screen crashes -> Create popup dialog
- Add support for foreground sprites to import/export functions
- We're almost done here; we should move on soon

### Main Game
- Make a mini-demo with simple walking
- Write method stubs for each class based on the UML diagram
    - Maybe start on init methods
